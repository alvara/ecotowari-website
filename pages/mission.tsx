          While papermaking and printing companies have made efforts over the
          years, paper manufacturing still requires large quantities of water,
          wood, energy and chemical products. For more details about the extent
          of the problem, check out the dedicated section on the environmental
          impact of flyers.

        <p>
          ecotowari is an initiative to tackle the waste generated by flyers
          through a mailbox sticker. The sticker indicates in positive, clear
          terms that you do not wish to receive flyers because you care about
          our planet. Simple as that. With tests carried out all around Tokyo,
          we have seen reduction rates of over 99%. Our early supporters have
          received virtually 0 flyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a cute and efficient sticker working for you in the background,
          you know that the next time you will open your mailbox, it will be to
          see the mail that matters!

          The initiative was launched in January 2022 in a sharehouse in
          Nippori, Tokyo.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Founder R√©my Millot recalls: ‚ÄúEver since I settled into my new home in
          Tokyo, I found the number of flyers pouring into my mailbox quite
          overwhelming. As a quick fix that somehow became permanent (as all
          quick fixes tend to be?) I put together some paper tape and a note
          saying I didn‚Äôt want to receive flyers. And much to my surprise, that
          very homemade-looking sticker proved to be working.
        </p>
        <p>
          My other housemates would also complain about receiving too many
          flyers. They liked the idea of a sticker but didn‚Äôt want it to be some
          homemade paper tape. That‚Äôs when I realized we needed a ‚Äúproper‚Äù
          sticker if we wanted this type of initiative to pick up and grow.
          ecotowari was born!‚Äù{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          The name ecotowari is a new word bringing together the words eco and
          kotowari, Japanese word for ‚Äúrefusing‚Äù. ecotowari means turning down
          single-use items for environmental reasons.

        title="What makes ecotowari unique?"
      >
        <p>
          We didn&apos;t invent the ‚Äú„ÉÅ„É©„Ç∑„ÅäÊñ≠„Çä‚Äù (chirashi okotowari ‚Äì no to
          flyers) stickers. They have indeed been around for a while and one can
          already see them on mailboxes here and there. However, we were unhappy
          with their design as no mention is made of the environment or waste
          reduction. They include very strong language such as &quot;you&apos;re
          being watched&quot; or &quot;we will report you to the police&quot;.
          We feel this type of wording is a barrier to a wider adoption and
          discourages people from putting them on their mailboxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal with ecotowari is to use a different kind of symbolism and
          language in order to create an inclusive and positive movement - for
          the planet - instead of the anti-anythingthatcomesnearmydoor approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the best thing about our stickers is that they‚Äôre just as
          efficient with over 99% reduction rates üòä
        </p>

          A single ecotowari sticker helps reduce waste generated by brochures
          by 85 grammes per week on average (tests done in the Tokyo region). It
          might not seem like much in itself but imagine the impact that all the
          ecotowari stickers together are having... No need to imagine it! We
          have laid it out below in our real-time impact generator ‚Üì
